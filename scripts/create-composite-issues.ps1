### Description:
The `{0}` composite component requires advanced implementation following TDD methodology with complex state management, multiple sub-components, and sophisticated user interactions. This is a high-complexity component that serves as a complete UI solution.

**Complexity Level**: ðŸ”´ **Complex Composite Component**
**Estimated Implementation**: Multiple iterations with comprehensive testing

### Composite Component Architecture:

#### 1. **Multi-Component Structure**:
   - Design component composition with multiple sub-components
   - Implement parent-child communication patterns
   - Create reusable sub-component interfaces
   - Support compound component patterns (e.g., `{0}.Header`, `{0}.Content`, `{0}.Footer`)

#### 2. **Advanced State Management**:
   - Use SolidJS stores for complex state coordination
   - Implement state persistence where appropriate
   - Handle asynchronous operations and loading states
   - Coordinate state between multiple component parts

#### 3. **Complex Interactions**:
   - Multi-step user flows and navigation
   - Advanced keyboard navigation patterns
   - Drag & drop functionality (if applicable)
   - Form validation and submission handling
   - Animation and transition management

### Implementation Standards:

#### 1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Extended**:
   - **RED**: Write comprehensive integration tests for complete user flows
   - **GREEN**: Implement component system to satisfy all test scenarios
   - **REFACTOR**: Optimize performance and maintainability
   - Test component composition and sub-component interactions
   - Include end-to-end user journey testing
   - Achieve 100% coverage including edge cases and error scenarios

#### 2. **Component System Architecture**:
   ```tsx
   // Example structure for composite components
   export interface {0}Props {{
     // Main component props
     children?: JSX.Element;
     class?: string;
     classList?: Record<string, boolean>;
     // Component-specific props...
   }}
   
   export interface {0}SubComponentProps {{
     // Sub-component specific props
   }}
   
   // Compound component pattern
   export default function {0}(props: {0}Props): JSX.Element;
   {0}.Header = {0}Header;
   {0}.Content = {0}Content;
   {0}.Footer = {0}Footer;
   ```

#### 3. **Advanced Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA+)**:
   - Complex ARIA relationships (`aria-owns`, `aria-controls`, `aria-describedby`)
   - Advanced keyboard navigation with arrow keys, tab trapping
   - Screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
   - Focus management across multiple component parts
   - High contrast and reduced motion support

#### 4. **DaisyUI Integration - Advanced**:
   - Support all DaisyUI modifier combinations
   - Implement responsive behavior patterns
   - Theme integration across all sub-components
   - Custom CSS variable support for advanced styling
   - Reference [DaisyUI {0} documentation](https://daisyui.com/components/{0}/)

#### 5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading of sub-components where appropriate
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Efficient re-rendering strategies
   - Bundle size optimization with tree-shaking

#### 6. **Error Handling & Resilience**:
   - Graceful degradation of complex features
   - Error boundaries for sub-component failures
   - Validation and sanitization of complex inputs
   - Recovery mechanisms for failed operations

### Comprehensive Test Coverage:

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Individual sub-component rendering and props
- [ ] State management functions and reducers
- [ ] Event handling and callbacks
- [ ] Props validation and default values

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Parent-child component communication
- [ ] State synchronization across components
- [ ] Event propagation and handling
- [ ] Theme and styling coordination

#### User Flow Tests:
- [ ] Complete user journeys (start to finish)
- [ ] Multi-step interaction patterns
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Accessibility compliance in complex flows

#### Performance Tests:

- [ ] Memory usage and cleanup
- [ ] Bundle size impact

### Reference Architecture:
- **Wizard Component Pattern**: Multi-step forms with navigation
- **Modal System**: Overlay management with focus trapping
- **Dropdown System**: Complex positioning and interaction
- **Timeline Component**: Dynamic content rendering with animations

### Implementation Phases:

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for basic component structure
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement core component shell and basic functionality
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Optimize basic structure and patterns

#### Phase 2: Sub-Components
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for all sub-components
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement individual sub-components
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Optimize sub-component patterns and reusability

#### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for component composition
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement parent-child communication and state coordination
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Optimize performance and state management

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for advanced interactions
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement complex user flows and edge cases
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Polish UX and optimize performance

#### Phase 5: Accessibility & Polish
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for complete accessibility compliance
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement advanced accessibility features
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Final optimization and documentation

### Documentation Requirements:
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation for all sub-components
- [ ] Usage examples for common patterns
- [ ] Migration guide from simple to advanced usage
- [ ] Performance optimization guide
- [ ] Accessibility implementation guide
- [ ] Update `docs/components/{0}.md` with complete documentation

### Integration Checklist:
- [ ] Verify export in `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Update demo application with comprehensive examples
- [ ] Test with multiple themes and responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Validate cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Performance audit and optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit with screen readers

### Additional Considerations:
- Consider server-side rendering compatibility
- Plan for future feature extensions
- Document migration paths for breaking changes
- Include comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Test with real-world usage scenarios
- Consider internationalization requirements
